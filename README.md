# C4 Compiler Analysis Assignment

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to thoroughly analyze and understand the structure, functionality, and implementation details of the **C4 compiler**. By the end of this assignment, you will be able to explain how the code works, identify its key components, and reason about its design decisions.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Annotate the Code
- Download the **C4 code** and add detailed comments to every function, block, and nontrivial line of code.
- Your comments should explain:
  - What the code does.
  - Why it is written in a particular way.
  - How it fits into the overall structure of the compiler.
- Save the annotated code as **`c4_annotated.c`**.

---

### 2. Draw a Detailed Diagram
- Create a diagram that represents the **architecture and data flow** of the C4 compiler. Include:
  - The main components (e.g., lexer, parser, virtual machine, etc.).
  - How data moves between these components.
  - Key data structures (e.g., tokens, instructions, stack, etc.).
- Save the diagram as **`c4_diagram.png`** or **`c4_diagram.pdf`**.

---

### 3. Collect Code Statistics
- Use **static and dynamic analysis tools** to collect the following statistics about the C4 code:
  - **Lines of code (LOC)** for the entire program and for individual functions.
  - **Cyclomatic complexity** of each function.
  - **Number of functions** and their sizes (in LOC).
  - **Number of global variables** and their usage.
  - **Number of unique tokens** and their frequency.
  - **Number of branches, loops, and their nesting levels**.
  - **Memory usage patterns** (e.g., stack vs. heap allocation).
- Write a summary of your findings in a file named **`c4_statistics.txt`**.

---

### 4. Explain Key Algorithms
- Write a **short report (1-2 pages)** explaining the following **algorithms or concepts** used in C4:
  - **The lexical analysis process:** How does the code identify and tokenize input?
  - **The parsing process:** How does the code construct an abstract syntax tree (AST) or equivalent representation?
  - **The virtual machine implementation:** How does the code execute the compiled instructions?
  - **The memory management approach:** How does the code handle memory allocation and deallocation?
- Save the report as **`c4_report.pdf`**.

---

### 5. Answer Conceptual Questions
- Provide written answers to the following questions:
  1. **What is the purpose of the `next()` function, and how does it contribute to the compilation process?**
  2. **How does C4 handle symbol resolution (e.g., variables, functions)?**
  3. **What are the limitations of C4 as a compiler? What features of C does it not support?**
  4. **How does C4 achieve self-hosting (i.e., compiling itself)? What are the implications of this design?**
- Save the answers in a file named **`c4_answers.txt`**.

---

### 6. Experiment with the Code (**Optional; Bonus 10%**)
- **Compile and run** the C4 compiler on your local machine.
- **Modify the code** to add a **new feature** or change an **existing behavior**. For example:
  - **Add support** for a new operator (e.g., `%` for modulus).
  - **Change the way** the virtual machine handles a specific instruction.
- Write a **short explanation** of your changes and how they affect the compilerâ€™s behavior.
- Save the modified code as **`c4_modified.c`** and the explanation as **`c4_modification_explanation.txt`**.
